    ans: "An armchair with a back that can be adjusted to lean backward, and a footrest that can be moved up to support the legs, or folded under the chair when the person is sitting up; the back and footrest are often geared so that they move together and separately, allowing the chair to be conveniently adjusted either for sitting up or for lying back; also called a reclining chair.",

    ans: "Slumping and hunching is bad for back pain, upright can be too. But reclining is not bad for back pain. In fact, research has identified that sitting in a reclined position is better for your back than sitting upright. We know that sitting upright for long periods of time can lead to back pain. The good news is that reclining can reduce back pain. Some experts have found that the off-loading sitting posture may reduce back pain in people whose situation requires prolonged sitting. The off-loading sitting posture means sitting with the back part of the seat tilted back 20° in comparison to the front part of the seat. Another research group discovered that a 135° body-thigh sitting posture is the best sitting position. This is when you recline backward 135° while your feet remain on the floor. Similarly, if you find that changing your sitting position more frequently helps alleviate your back pain, a chair that is adjustable can make life a lot easier. Recline into different positions and put your feet up, easily, just by pressing a button. And when you’re ready to stand up, there’s a button for that too. Some people with back pain may find that elevating their legs also helps –  A footstool is one way of achieving this. Another option is a rise and recline chair that elevates your legs for you.",
